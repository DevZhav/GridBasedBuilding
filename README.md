# GridBasedBuilding
Fortnite Building Remake


This  should be a remake of the Fortnite Building System.
This Project is discontinued.





Short Introduction : 

- it is still a Prototype
- alot of the Code isnt commented(tryin to do this)

- ok, like the name said based on a  3D Grid
- each Grid Node stores some Information
- like Nighbours about wich i split in static and dynamic Nighbours
- static nighbour is the nighbour in world Position so it is always the same
- dynamic nighbour is based on the rotation/direction of the custom Gizmo

- simple Terrain/Ground Collision Check


I didnt find a good way to solve the tons of conditios wich are needed for the Wall,Ramp,Floor Placement.
Also for the chain destruction i thought of saving all required Nighbours wich was the wrong way of doing it.

Take a look in the GridNode.cs for more Information :D have fun to see some horror code

About the GridNode Recognition , it uses cardinal points mixing Y and Z Axis Rotation.

Have Fun =D
